My take on Conway's Game of Life
Modules use: pygame, turtle, time, random, and their dependencies if any.
conway,py uses turtle(just because I wanted to remember the old days)
conway1.py uses pygame (this one is the nice one)

Red button affects the speed (via clock.tick(speed)), turns green for slower speed
Blue button creates a random spread,
Yellow one ages the grid once
White one clears the grid
To pause press any key.

03/08 - "drag"
  added a drag function, so that creating custom seeds is even easier (especially on large tables)



Planning to add:
  -visible cue for pausing
  -visible cue for dragging
  
  -support for rectangular grid
